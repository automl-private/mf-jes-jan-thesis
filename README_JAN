This is my fork of mf-prior-exp. Most things here are not upstreamable.

To install dependencies install git submudules and then run:

pip install -r deps2.txt
pip install botorch -U    (this currently installs botorch 0.8.2)
pip install -e .

Benchmarks get run by running `run.sh`.
Plots get generated by running `plot.sh`
